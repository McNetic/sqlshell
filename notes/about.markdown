[SQLShell][sqlshell] is an open source SQL command line tool, written in
[Scala][scala]; it is similar in concept to tools like Oracle's
[SQL*Plus][sqlplus], the PostgreSQL `psql` command, and MySQL's `mysql`
tool. SQLShell has history management, readline-like support (with tab
completion), and other useful features.
