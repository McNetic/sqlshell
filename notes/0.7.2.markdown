* Fixed a bug: In a join, when display columns from two separate tables that
  happen to have the same name, SQLShell was only displaying one of the columns.

* Fixed a SQL Server-specific problem with SQL Server `set` commands, such
  as `set showplan_text on;`, which reported errors, even though they worked.
  Reported by Mark D. Anderson (*mda /at/ discerning.com*).

* Corrected some config-file exception messages (noted in a personal email,
  by *brian.ewins /at/ gmail.com*) by pulling in a new version of the
  [Grizzled Scala][] library.
