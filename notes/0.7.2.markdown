* Fixed a bug: In a join, when display columns from two separate tables that
  happen to have the same name, SQLShell was only displaying one of the columns.

* Corrected some config-file exception messages (noted by
  *brian.ewins /at/ gmail.com*) by pulling in a new version of the
  [Grizzled Scala][] library.
