* Incorporated a new version of the [Grizzled Scala library][grizzled-scala],
  which enhances history handling and fixes some command interpreter bugs.
* Fix: SQLShell was accessing result set metadata after the result set was
  closed. With some databases (e.g., H2), this causes an exception to be
  thrown.
- Factored Markdown and EditFile logic into separate [SBT
  plugins][sbt-plugins], simplifying the build.
