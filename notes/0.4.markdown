* Converted to Scala 2.8.0.
* Now must be compiled with [SBT][sbt] version 0.7.0 or better.
* Added ability to suppress display of `SELECT` result set.
* Added ability to sort the names of the columns in a `.desc TABLE` command,
  depending on the value of the `sortcolnames` setting.
* Got rid of MarkdownJ as the Markdown processor; it's buggy and not maintained
  any more. Markdown is now processed with the Showdown Javascript Markdown
  parser, invoked via Mozilla Rhino.
* Simplified internal `JDBCHelper` class.
* Now bundles `javaeditline.jar` (but not the accompanying JNI library).
  See the [javaeditline web site][javaeditline] for details.
