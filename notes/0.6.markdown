* Fixed bug: Assertion failure when you type ".capture off", but you're not
  currently capturing anything.
* Updated to Scala 2.8.0.RC2.
* Updated to posterous-sbt 0.1.5.
* Replaced uses of now-deprecated `Math` functions with corresponding functions
  from `scala.math`.
* Updated to [SBT][] version 0.7.3
* Updated to [Grizzled Scala][] version 0.6, to pick up changes to
  `grizzled.cmd.CommandInterpreter` that address [Issue #3][issue 3]
  (unknown database name on command line causes SQLShell to leave the terminal
  in a weird state when it exits, when using the EditLine package).
* Updated license to include license terms and copyrights for all third-party
  software shipped with SQLShell.
* Some internal cosmetic code changes.
* Now uses Markdown plugin, instead of doing Markdown inline.
* Uses new `org.clapper` [IzPack][] plugin to build installer, instead of
  using an external XML configuration file.
* Removed no-longer-necessary dependency on [IzPack][] standalone compiler.
* Updated to version 0.6.1 of the [Grizzled Scala][] library.
* Updated usage of `grizzled.config.Configuration` to remove uses of newly
  deprecated methods.
* Corrected SBT build's retrieval of 2.7.7 (old) Grizzled-Scala, needed for
  SBT build file to compile.
