* Fixed a command completion error in the `.show` command.
* Possible completions are now displayed in columns, not one per line.
* SQLShell now supports `--sqlshell-block-begin` and `--sqlshell-block-end`
  structured comments, used to delineate multi-statement SQL that must be
  run all at once, such as stored procedure definitions. See the User's
  Guide for complete details.
* The `showbinary` setting has been renamed to `maxbinary`.
* Added a `maxcompletions` setting, controlling how many possible completions
  are shown when tab-completion results in multiple choices.
* SQLShell now permits setting the primary prompt, via `".set prompt"`.
  The prompt string can contain escapes, such as `"%db%"` (which substitutes
  the current database name) and `"%user%"` (which substitutes the name of
  the connected user). See the User's Guide for details.
* Now uses [SBT][sbt] 0.7.2 to build from source.
