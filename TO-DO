- Add ability to change transaction isolation level

- Fix completion handler:
  + Implement a custom interface to EditLine (and, perhaps, Readline).
    JavaReadline doesn't expose enough of the underlying API.

- Support this kind of syntax: .desc ?
  Identical to: ? .desc

- Add ability to do ".history regex" to show only commands matching the
  regex.
