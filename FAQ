1. How do I get GNU Readline to work?

   Mac OS X:

       Follow the instructions at the following web page:
       http://blog.toonetown.com/2006/07/java-readline-on-mac-os-x-update.html

       This approach actually uses the Editline library, not GNU Readline.
       To customize the bindings, see editrc(5)

   Ubuntu:
       - Install the libreadline-java package
       - Ensure that /usr/share/java/libreadline-java.jar is in your
         CLASSPATH
       - Ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains /usr/lib/jni
