<h1>SQLShell: A SQL Command Shell</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SQLShell is a SQL command line tool, similar in concept to tools like
Oracle's
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/docs/tech/sql_plus/index.html">SQL*Plus</a>,
the PostgreSQL <tt>psql</tt> command, and MySQL's <tt>mysql</tt> tool.</p>

<h2>Some Features at a Glance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Connection parameters for individual databases can be kept in a
      configuration file in your home directory, allowing you to specify a
      short logical name for the database when you connect to it. (Multiple
      logical names are permitted for each database.)</li>
  <li>SQLShell has command history management, with GNU Readline-like
      support. Each database has its own history file.</li>
  <li>SQLShell supports retrieving and displaying database metadata (e.g.,
      getting a list of tables, querying the table's columns and their
      data types, listing the indexes and foreign keys for a table, etc.).</li>
  <li>SQLShell provides a standard interface that looks and behaves the same
      no matter what database you're using.</li>
  <li>SQLShell supports any database engine or which a JDBC driver exists.</li>
  <li>SQLShell is written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
      and uses some third-party, open-source Scala and Java libraries.</li>
  <li>SQLShell is open source, and is licensed under a liberal BSD-style
      license.</li>
</ul>
