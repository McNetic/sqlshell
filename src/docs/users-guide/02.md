## Installation

### Prerequisites

SQLShell requires the following:

- An installed Java 6 runtime.
- Appropriate JDBC drivers for the database(s) you want to use.

SQLShell comes bundled with an appropriate version of the [Scala][scala]
runtime, so you do *not* need to have Scala installed to use SQLShell.

[scala]: http://www.scala-lang.org/

### Installing SQLShell

Install SQLShell via the graphical installer jar, available in the
[downloads area][] of the [SQLShell GitHub repository][]:

java -jar sqlshell-0.7.3-installer.jar
This command will install SQLShell, a front-end Unix shell script or Windows BAT file, and all the dependencies.
