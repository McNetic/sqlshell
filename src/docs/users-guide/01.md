## Features at a Glance

Some of SQLShell's features:

* Connection parameters for individual databases can be kept in a
  configuration file in your home directory, allowing you to specify a
  short logical name for the database when you connect to it. (Multiple
  logical names are permitted for each database.)
* SQLShell has command history management, with GNU Readline-like
  support. Each database has its own history file.
* SQLShell supports retrieving and displaying database metadata (e.g.,
  getting a list of tables, querying the table's columns and their
  data types, listing the indexes and foreign keys for a table, etc.).
* SQLShell provides a standard interface that looks and behaves the same
  no matter what database you're using.
* SQLShell supports any database engine for which a JDBC driver exists.
* SQLShell is written in [Scala][scala] and uses some third-party, open-source
  Scala and Java libraries.
* SQLShell is open source, and is licensed under a liberal BSD license.

In short, SQLShell is a SQL command tool that attempts to provide the same
interface for all supported databases and across all platforms.
