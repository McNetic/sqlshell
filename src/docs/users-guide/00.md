SQLShell Users Guide
====================

SQLShell is a SQL command line tool, similar in concept to tools like
Oracle's [SQL Plus][sqlplus], the [PostgreSQL][postgresql] `psql` command,
and the [MySQL][mysql] `mysql` tool.

[sqlplus]: http://www.oracle.com/technology/docs/tech/sql_plus/index.html
[postgresql]: http://www.postgresql.org/
[mysql]: http://www.mysql.com/

SQLShell is a [Scala][scala] rewrite of my Python *sqlcmd* tool (rewritten
because, as it turns out, I think JDBC is more consistent and portable than
Python's DB API).
