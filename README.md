SQLShell: A SQL Command Shell
=============================

**Warning**: While this project isn't [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware),
exactly, I don't use it much any more, so it doesn't get a lot of maintenance love.

Introduction
------------

SQLShell is a SQL command line tool, similar in concept to tools like
Oracle's [SQL*Plus] [sqlplus], the PostgreSQL `psql` command, and
MySQL's `mysql` tool.

SQLShell is a [Scala][] rewrite of my Python [*sqlcmd*][] tool (rewritten
because, as it turns out, JDBC is more consistent and portable than
Python's DB API).

Some Features at a Glance
-------------------------

* Connection parameters for individual databases can be kept in a
  configuration file in your home directory, allowing you to specify a
  short logical name for the database when you connect to it. (Multiple
  logical names are permitted for each database.)

* SQLShell has command history management, with GNU Readline-like
  support. Each database can have its own history file; you can also share
  history files across two or more databases.

* SQLShell supports retrieving and displaying database metadata (e.g.,
  getting a list of tables, querying the table's columns and their
  data types, listing the indexes and foreign keys for a table, etc.).

* SQLShell provides a standard interface that looks and behaves the same,
  no matter what database you're using.

* SQLShell supports any database engine for which a JDBC driver exists.

* SQLShell is written in [Scala][].

* SQLShell is open source, and is licensed under a liberal BSD-style
  license.
