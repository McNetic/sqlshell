Version 0.5 (...)

- Fixed a command completion error in the ".show" command.
- Completions are now displayed in a columnar fashion.
- SQLShell now supports --sqlshell-block-begin and --sqlshell-block-end
  structured comments, used to delineate multi-statement SQL that must be
  run all at once, such as stored procedure definitions. See the User's
  Guide for details.
- The "showbinary" setting has been renamed to "maxbinary".
- Added a "maxcompletions" setting, controlling how many possible completions
  are shown when tab-completion results in multiple choices.
- SQLShell now permits setting the primary prompt, via ".set prompt".
  The prompt string can contain escapes, such as "%db%" (which substitutes
  the current database name) and "%user%" (which substitutes the name of
  the connected user). See the User's Guide for details.
- Now requires sbt 0.7.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.1 (2 March, 2010)

- Incorporated new Grizzled Scala library, which enhances history handling
  and fixes some command interpreter bugs.
- SQLShell was accessing result set metadata after the result set was closed.
  With some databases (e.g., H2), this causes an exception to be thrown.
- Factored Markdown and EditFile logic into separate SBT plugins, simplifying
  the build.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4 (20 February, 2010)

- Converted to Scala 2.8.0.
- Now must be compiled with sbt version 0.7.0 or better.
- Added ability to suppress display of SELECT result set.
- Added ability to sort the names of the columns in a ".desc TABLE" command,
  depending on the value of the "sortcolnames" setting.
- Got rid of MarkdownJ as the Markdown processor; it's buggy and not maintained
  any more. Markdown is now processed with the Showdown Javascript Markdown
  parser, invoked via Mozilla Rhino.
- Simplified internal JDBCHelper class.
- Now bundles javaeditline.jar (but not the accompanying JNI library).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 (14 December, 2009)

- Fixed infinite recursion when receiving results.
- Fixed handling of --version and --help options.
- Added build time to --version output.
- Fixed OutOfMemoryError problems on large result sets.
- Changed how retrieval and execution times are displayed, to give slightly
  better real-time feedback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2 (31 August, 2009)

- Enhanced the tab-completion logic so that SQL statements tab-complete
  on table names.
- Now works properly with Microsoft Access tables (though ".show tables"
  doesn't work, with the JDBC-ODBC bridge). With MS Access and the JDBC-ODBC
  bridge, you can't retrieve the same column more than once.
- Installer now bundles scala-library.jar, and front-end shell scripts
  now use Java, not Scala executable. This change means Scala does not
  have to be installed on the machine for SQLShell to run.

Version 0.1 (3 August, 2009)

- Posted to the web.
