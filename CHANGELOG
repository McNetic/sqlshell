Version 0.4 (...)

- Added ability to suppress display of SELECT result set.
- Added ability to sort the names of the columns in a ".desc TABLE" command,
  depending on the value of the "sortcolnames" setting.
- Converted to Scala 2.8.0.
- Now must be compiled with xsbt (sbt version 0.6.x)
- Got rid of MarkdownJ as the Markdown processor; it's buggy and not maintained
  any more. Markdown is now processed with the Showdown Javascript Markdown parser,
  invoked via Mozilla Rhino.

Version 0.3 (14 December, 2009)

- Fixed infinite recursion when receiving results.
- Fixed handling of --version and --help options.
- Added build time to --version output.
- Fixed OutOfMemoryError problems on large result sets.
- Changed how retrieval and execution times are displayed, to give slightly
  better real-time feedback.

Version 0.2 (31 August, 2009)

- Enhanced the tab-completion logic so that SQL statements tab-complete
  on table names.
- Now works properly with Microsoft Access tables (though ".show tables"
  doesn't work, with the JDBC-ODBC bridge). With MS Access and the JDBC-ODBC
  bridge, you can't retrieve the same column more than once.
- Installer now bundles scala-library.jar, and front-end shell scripts
  now use Java, not Scala executable. This change means Scala does not
  have to be installed on the machine for SQLShell to run.

Version 0.1 (3 August, 2009)

- Posted to the web.
