Version 0.2 (31 August, 2009)

- Enhanced the tab-completion logic so that SQL statements tab-complete
  on table names.
- Now works properly with Microsoft Access tables (though ".show tables"
  doesn't work, with the JDBC-ODBC bridge). With MS Access and the JDBC-ODBC
  bridge, you can't retrieve the same column more than once.
- Installer now bundles scala-library.jar, and front-end shell scripts
  now use Java, not Scala executable. This change means Scala does not
  have to be installed on the machine for SQLShell to run.
