Version 0.2 (...)

- Enhanced the tab-completion logic so that SQL statements tab-complete
  on table names.
- Installer now bundles scala-library.jar, and front-end shell scripts
  now use Java, not Scala executable. This change means Scala does not
  have to be installed on the machine for SQLShell to run.
